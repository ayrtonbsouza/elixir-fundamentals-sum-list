# SumList

This is an application developed as a lesson for Elixir Ignite Bootcamp, proposed by RocketSeat.

## About the challenge

In this lesson, I learned how to create a function that, given a list of numbers (for example: `[1, 3, 6, 43, 6]`), calculates, **recursively**, the sum of all elements.

For example, we have the following input and output expected by the function that receives the list:

``` bash
iex> ListLength.call ([1, 2, 3])
...> 6
```

If you want to test this implementation from the terminal, run `iex -S mix` inside the project's root directory ðŸš€
